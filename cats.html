            <h1>Cat Owners</h1>
            <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most
                popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care
                and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the
                well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.</p>

            <h2>Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
            <p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing)
                directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate
                is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to
                feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain
                weight appropriately include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk,</li>
                <li>gastrointestinal disease,</li>
                <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
            <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft, wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after
                birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half
                to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has
                difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is
                optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and
                wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always
                consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>

            <h2>One Year to Seven Years</h2>
            <p>This age is when kittens reach the "cat" stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their
                level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to
                leave food out for
                the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple of times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking
                throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
            </p>

            <h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
            <p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at
                this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
                packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and
                <strong>not</strong> just a category (such as "fish"). This usually means they are byproducts or
                combinations of lesser
                quality proteins.
